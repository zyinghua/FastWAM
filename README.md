This repository contains the training and evaluation code for FastWAM on LIBERO / RoboTwin.

## What's New

FastWAM is now faster, better suited to large-scale datasets, and more flexible
for research. This update brings substantially faster training and inference,
native LeRobot v3.0 support, and a new model that can switch between acting with
and without future imagination.

### ⚡ Approximately 2x faster inference

End-to-end FastWAM inference is now approximately **2x faster**, including text
encoding and VAE encoding:

- **NVIDIA H20:** 470 ms → 210 ms
- **NVIDIA RTX 4090:** 190 ms → 110 ms

The accelerated path is enabled by default for LIBERO with
`EVALUATION.compile_action_infer=true`. We gratefully acknowledge
[PR #43](https://github.com/yuantianyuan01/FastWAM/pull/43) for proposing the
optimization ideas that inspired this work. Existing checkpoints remain fully
compatible with the accelerated inference path.

### 🚀 Approximately 10% faster training

FastWAM training is approximately **10% faster on NVIDIA H20 GPUs**. The new
training path combines a compiled denoising core with batched VAE encoding and
a lightweight CUDA Graph backend. Enable denoising compilation with:

```bash
bash scripts/train_zero1.sh 8 task=libero_uncond_2cam224_1e-4 \
  model.compile_training_denoise=true
```

Both cached text embeddings and on-the-fly T5 encoding are supported. The
latter skips text-cache preprocessing and is more convenient, at the cost of
approximately 10% lower training throughput.

### 📦 Native LeRobot 2.1 and 3.0 support

FastWAM now supports both **LeRobot 2.1 and LeRobot 3.0** datasets. LeRobot 3.0's
chunked parquet and video layout scales better to large datasets, with faster
data loading and dataset-statistics computation as the dataset grows.

Download the released LeRobot 3.0 LIBERO dataset from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuanty/LIBERO-fastwam) and select
the v3.0 data config:

```bash
huggingface-cli download yuanty/LIBERO-fastwam \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --include "lerobot_v30/**" \
  --local-dir ./data

python scripts/train.py task=libero_uncond_2cam224_1e-4 \
  data=libero_2cam_lerobot_v30
```

For another LeRobot 3.0 dataset, copy
`configs/data/libero_2cam_lerobot_v30.yaml`, update `train.dataset_dirs`, and
select the new config with `data=<config_name>`. Existing LeRobot 2.1 configs
continue to work unchanged.

### 🧠 Optional IDM: one model, two thinking modes

Optional IDM is a new FastWAM variant that supports **two inference modes in a
single model**:

- **IDM mode:** imagine the future video first, then predict actions.
- **First-frame mode (Fast-WAM):** skip test-time future imagination and predict
  actions directly from the current observation.

Download the released Optional IDM checkpoint from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/yuanty/fastwam):

```bash
huggingface-cli download yuanty/fastwam \
  libero_optional_idm_2cam224.pt \
  libero_optional_idm_2cam224_dataset_stats.json \
  --local-dir ./checkpoints/fastwam_release
```

Train the optional-IDM variant once:

```bash
bash scripts/train_zero1.sh 8 task=libero_optional_idm_2cam224_1e-4
```

Then choose either inference mode at evaluation time without retraining, making
it easy to study when future imagination helps:

```bash
python experiments/libero/run_libero_manager.py \
  task=libero_optional_idm_2cam224_1e-4 \
  ckpt=./checkpoints/fastwam_release/libero_optional_idm_2cam224.pt \
  EVALUATION.dataset_stats_path=./checkpoints/fastwam_release/libero_optional_idm_2cam224_dataset_stats.json \
  EVALUATION.sigma_shift=1.0 \
  +EVALUATION.action_infer_mode=idm \
  MULTIRUN.num_gpus=8
```

Replace `idm` with `first_frame` to use the Fast-WAM inference mode.

The released checkpoint, trained with action scheduler shift `1.0`, achieves
the following success rates on the full LIBERO benchmark (40 tasks, 50 episodes
per task):

| Inference mode | Spatial | Goal | Object | Long | Average |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| IDM | 99.0% | 98.6% | 99.6% | 97.0% | **98.55%** |
| First-frame (Fast-WAM) | 98.2% | 97.8% | 99.2% | 95.8% | **97.75%** |

### Other improvements

- The action scheduler shift now defaults to `1.0` for both training and
  evaluation; shifts from `1.0` to `3.0` perform similarly in our experiments.
  When evaluating the original released checkpoints, set
  `EVALUATION.sigma_shift=5.0` to reproduce the original setting.
- Upgraded LIBERO evaluation with persistent model workers, dynamic task
  scheduling, bad-GPU quarantine, failure recovery, and resumable results.
- Optimized action-only inference for IDM and Optional IDM: `infer_action`
  returns actions and video latents directly, while VAE decoding is performed
  only by `infer_joint` when video output is requested, eliminating redundant
  computation in action-only deployments.

## Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n fastwam python=3.10 -y
conda activate fastwam
pip install -U pip
pip install torch==2.7.1+cu128 torchvision==0.22.1+cu128 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install -e .
```

## Model Preparation

This step is required before both training and inference.

Step 1: set the Wan model directory first (opional, default `./checkpoints`):

```bash
mkdir -p checkpoints
export DIFFSYNTH_MODEL_BASE_PATH="$(pwd)/checkpoints"
```

Step 2: pre-generate the ActionDiT backbone (interpolated from Wan22 DiT):

```bash
# uncond (fastwam)
python scripts/preprocess_action_dit_backbone.py \
  --model-config configs/model/fastwam.yaml \
  --output checkpoints/ActionDiT_linear_interp_Wan22_alphascale_1024hdim.pt \
  --device cuda \
  --dtype bfloat16
```

## Dataset Download

### LIBERO

The preprocessed LIBERO dataset used by Fast-WAM is available at:

- https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuanty/LIBERO-fastwam

Download all compressed files first, then extract them all:

```bash
mkdir -p data/libero_mujoco3.3.2
cd data/libero_mujoco3.3.2

# Run after downloading all 4 tar.gz files
for f in *.tar.gz; do
  tar -xzf "$f"
done
```

The extracted directory structure should be:

```text
data/libero_mujoco3.3.2/
├── libero_10_no_noops_lerobot/
├── libero_goal_no_noops_lerobot/
├── libero_object_no_noops_lerobot/
└── libero_spatial_no_noops_lerobot/
```

### RoboTwin

The preprocessed RoboTwin dataset used by Fast-WAM is available at:

- https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuanty/robotwin2.0-fastwam

Download all split archive files first, then concatenate and extract:

```bash
mkdir -p data/robotwin2.0
cd data/robotwin2.0

# Run after downloading all robotwin2.0.tar.gz.part-* files
cat robotwin2.0.tar.gz.part-* | tar -xzf -
```

The extracted directory structure should be:

```text
data/robotwin2.0/
└── robotwin2.0/
    ├── data/
    ├── meta/
    └── videos/
```

If you also keep:

```text
data/robotwin2.0/dataset_stats.json
```

in the root directory, it can be used directly as the statistics file for the current configs in this repo. You can also recompute it.

## Inference with Released Checkpoints

The released checkpoints and their corresponding dataset stats are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/yuanty/fastwam).

Optional: download released checkpoints and dataset stats from Hugging Face:

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub

huggingface-cli download yuanty/fastwam \
  libero_uncond_2cam224.pt \
  libero_uncond_2cam224_dataset_stats.json \
  libero_optional_idm_2cam224.pt \
  libero_optional_idm_2cam224_dataset_stats.json \
  robotwin_uncond_3cam_384.pt \
  robotwin_uncond_3cam_384_dataset_stats.json \
  --local-dir ./checkpoints/fastwam_release
```

After downloading, the local directory is expected to contain:

```text
checkpoints/fastwam_release/
├── libero_uncond_2cam224.pt
├── libero_uncond_2cam224_dataset_stats.json
├── libero_optional_idm_2cam224.pt
├── libero_optional_idm_2cam224_dataset_stats.json
├── robotwin_uncond_3cam_384.pt
└── robotwin_uncond_3cam_384_dataset_stats.json
```

Before running the `LIBERO` benchmark, install the official LIBERO environment first
from the [LIBERO repository](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO).
Then run this final step:

```bash
pip install mujoco==3.3.2
```

The `mujoco` environment should ideally stay consistent with the LIBERO data version.

We have already copied the `RoboTwin` evaluation-related code into `third_party/RoboTwin`.
You still need to follow the official RoboTwin instructions from the
[RoboTwin repository](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin) to finish environment installation and download the required assets, then create the policy symlink:

```bash
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/experiments/robotwin/fastwam_policy" "$(pwd)/third_party/RoboTwin/policy/fastwam_policy"
```

Optional: evaluate released LIBERO checkpoint:

The released `LIBERO` / `RoboTwin` evaluation managers default to `8` GPUs
(`MULTIRUN.num_gpus=8` in `configs/sim_libero.yaml` and `configs/sim_robotwin.yaml`).
If you want to evaluate with fewer GPUs, pass a smaller value such as
`MULTIRUN.num_gpus=4`.

```bash
python experiments/libero/run_libero_manager.py \
  task=libero_uncond_2cam224_1e-4 \
  ckpt=./checkpoints/fastwam_release/libero_uncond_2cam224.pt \
  EVALUATION.dataset_stats_path=./checkpoints/fastwam_release/libero_uncond_2cam224_dataset_stats.json \
  EVALUATION.sigma_shift=5.0 \
  MULTIRUN.num_gpus=8
```

Optional: evaluate released RoboTwin checkpoint:

```bash
python experiments/robotwin/run_robotwin_manager.py \
  task=robotwin_uncond_3cam_384_1e-4 \
  ckpt=./checkpoints/fastwam_release/robotwin_uncond_3cam_384.pt \
  EVALUATION.dataset_stats_path=./checkpoints/fastwam_release/robotwin_uncond_3cam_384_dataset_stats.json \
  EVALUATION.sigma_shift=5.0 \
  MULTIRUN.num_gpus=8
```

For faster RoboTwin evaluation, we have enabled `EVALUATION.skip_get_obs_within_replan=true` in [`configs/sim_robotwin.yaml`](./configs/sim_robotwin.yaml).
This skips RGB rendering while consecutively executing an action chunk within one replan window, which speeds up evaluation but makes the saved video look very low-FPS.
Set it to `false` if you want to save a fully rendered video.

**Note:** We evaluate with **unseen** instructions, following Motus. [Lingbot-VA](https://github.com/Robbyant/lingbot-va/blob/661d52a59dc634a650efcd10a79d06bbb17ea81f/evaluation/robotwin/eval_polict_client_openpi.py#L308) uses **seen** instructions instead. You can try `EVALUATION.instruction_type=seen` to use **seen** instructions, which should theoretically improve performance by one or two points.

## Training

### 1) Precompute T5 embedding cache before training

Existing caches can be either padded to `context_len` (128 by default) or
padding-trimmed, such as `text_embeds_cache_trimmed`. The dataset loader restores
trailing zero embeddings and a false padding mask in memory, retaining the
existing model-input behavior. Keep `context_len=128` for `t5_len128` files;
no cache rewriting, embedding recomputation, or extra flag is needed.

Use `scripts/precompute_text_embeds.py` to precompute embeddings for each training task:

```bash
# LIBERO
python scripts/precompute_text_embeds.py task=libero_uncond_2cam224_1e-4

# RoboTwin
python scripts/precompute_text_embeds.py task=robotwin_uncond_3cam_384_1e-4
```

For multi-GPU:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/precompute_text_embeds.py task=libero_uncond_2cam224_1e-4
```

### 2) Training (using `fastwam` as an example)

When running a new task for the first time, set `pretrained_norm_stats` in the corresponding `configs/data/*.yaml` to `null` first.
After one training run, a `dataset_stats.json` file will be generated in the current run directory (for example, `runs/{task_name}/{run_id}/dataset_stats.json`).
You can then update `pretrained_norm_stats` to that file path for subsequent runs.

```bash
# LIBERO
bash scripts/train_zero1.sh 8 task=libero_uncond_2cam224_1e-4

# RoboTwin
bash scripts/train_zero1.sh 8 task=robotwin_uncond_3cam_384_1e-4
```

For LIBERO, we train on a single node with 8 GPUs. For RoboTwin, we use 64 GPUs to accelerate training. You can try reducing the GPU count or training epochs.

### Selected-six-task RoboTwin baseline (aligned with RollingWAM)

`configs/data/robotwin_selected_tasks.yaml` selects `lift_pot`,
`beat_block_hammer`, `place_dual_shoes`, `stack_bowls_two`,
`blocks_ranking_size`, and `stack_blocks_three`. The default is **50 clean
demonstrations per task, 300 total**, with no training holdout. The validation
loader still takes 1% (three episodes) from the same pool, matching RollingWAM;
its losses/videos are diagnostics, not held-out evaluation.

The training budget matches RollingWAM's single-node presets: four epochs,
effective batch size 128, cosine learning rate `1e-4`, weight decay `1e-2`,
BF16, ZeRO-2, and evaluation every 200 optimizer steps.

| Preset | GPUs | Batch/GPU | Gradient accumulation | Save every (steps) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `robotwin_selected_tasks_uncond_3cam_384_1e-4` | 8 | 8 | 2 | 666 |
| `robotwin_selected_tasks_uncond_3cam_384_1e-4_4gpu` | 4 | 4 | 8 | 200 |

FastWAM keeps its own model: 32-action training horizon, Wan2.2 video weights,
and the interpolated 1024-dimensional ActionDiT from Model Preparation step 2.
RollingWAM's rolling-window horizon and attention settings are not copied.
FastWAM's existing optional W&B setting remains disabled by default.

The default paths are `/datasets/robotwin2.0-fastwam/robotwin2.0` and
`/datasets/robotwin2.0-fastwam/text_embeds_cache/<task_name>`. All six precomputed
text-cache directories must be present; no embedding recomputation is needed.
Leave `pretrained_norm_stats: null` for the new six-task mixture: training
generates the run's `dataset_stats.json`, and validation reuses it automatically.
Do not reuse statistics or resume state from an old three-task run for a fresh
six-task comparison.

After preparing the Wan components and interpolated ActionDiT checkpoint:

```bash
# Four GPUs, IDs 0,1,2,3 by default.
bash scripts/robotwin/train_selected_tasks_fastwam_4gpu.sh

# Or eight GPUs, IDs 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 by default.
bash scripts/robotwin/train_selected_tasks_fastwam_8gpu.sh
```

These wrappers use the repository's `checkpoints` directory and disable model
downloads by default. Explicit `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`,
`DIFFSYNTH_MODEL_BASE_PATH`, and `DIFFSYNTH_SKIP_DOWNLOAD` values are respected.
Choose four or eight visible GPUs to match the wrapper, and append Hydra
overrides as usual (for example `data.dataset_root=/your/dataset/robotwin2.0`).
Edit `data.selected_task_names` in the data YAML to change the task list.

## Inference with Your Trained Checkpoints

The `mujoco` environment should ideally stay consistent with the LIBERO data version. Then run LIBERO evaluation:

```bash
# LIBERO
python experiments/libero/run_libero_manager.py task={task_name} ckpt={ckpt_path}
```

We have already copied the `RoboTwin` evaluation-related code into `third_party/RoboTwin`.
You still need to follow the official RoboTwin instructions from the
[RoboTwin repository](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin).
Finish installation and download the required assets, then create the policy symlink:

```bash
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/experiments/robotwin/fastwam_policy" "$(pwd)/third_party/RoboTwin/policy/fastwam_policy"
```

Then run RoboTwin evaluation:

```bash
python experiments/robotwin/run_robotwin_manager.py task={task_name} ckpt={ckpt_path}
```

Common `task_name` examples:

```text
libero_uncond_2cam224_1e-4
robotwin_uncond_3cam_384_1e-4
```
